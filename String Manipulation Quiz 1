#.toUpperCase() is a string method, meaning it acts on the string it's attached to, which in this case is the "U" from s[1]
#.slice() is another string method, which acts on the string s in this case.
#.slice(start, [end]) will grab the part of the string from the index of start to the index of end. 
#The fact that [end] shows up in brackets means that it's optional. 
#If it isn't there, then .slice() will select all of the string from start to the very end of the string. s.slice(2) gives us "dacity".
